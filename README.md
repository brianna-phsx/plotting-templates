This is the plotting template to use for all phsx 216/218 lab plots except for the projectile motion lab. 
This plotting template performs a linear fit to your data, with a best fit line in the form y=mx+b. 
The annotation on the plot gives you the values of m (the slope) and b (the vertical intercept), including their uncertainties. 
The PDF titled "How to use the plotting template and upload a plot" has step-by-step instructions, and can be found in the Course Resources module on Canvas.
